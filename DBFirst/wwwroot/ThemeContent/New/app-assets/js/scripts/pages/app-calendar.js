/**
 * ! If both start and end dates are same Full calendar will nullify the end date value.
 * ! Full calendar will end the event on a day before at 12:00:00AM thus, event won't extend to the end date.
 * ! We are getting events from a separate file named app-calendar-events.js. You can add or remove events from there.
